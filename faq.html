                    Q: Why did you choose Random Forest instead of other algorithms?
                </div>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>
                        <strong>Answer:</strong> Random Forest is an excellent choice for structured financial data 
                        like credit risk prediction for several reasons:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <strong>High Accuracy:</strong> Random Forest combines multiple decision trees, which 
                            makes it very accurate for classification problems. It often performs better than a 
                            single decision tree.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Prevents Overfitting:</strong> By using multiple trees and averaging their 
                            predictions, Random Forest reduces the risk of overfitting (memorizing the training data 
                            instead of learning general patterns).
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Handles Mixed Data Types:</strong> It works well with both numerical features 
                            (like age and income) and categorical features (like loan intent) without needing 
                            extensive preprocessing.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Feature Importance:</strong> Random Forest can tell us which features are most 
                            important for predictions (e.g., income might be more important than age), which helps 
                            with interpretability.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Robust to Outliers:</strong> Financial data often has outliers (unusual values), 
                            and Random Forest handles them better than some other algorithms.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Why not Deep Learning?</strong> Deep Learning (neural networks) is great for complex 
                        data like images or text, but for structured tabular data like credit risk, Random Forest 
                        often performs just as well and is simpler, faster to train, and easier to interpret.

                <div class="faq-question">
                    Q: How is the safety percentage calculated?
                </div>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>
                        <strong>Answer:</strong> The safety percentage comes from the <code>predict_proba()</code> 
                        method in scikit-learn. Here's how it works:
                    </p>
                    <div class="code-block">
<code><span class="comment"># Get probability predictions</span>
probabilities = model.predict_proba(features)[<span class="string">0</span>]

<span class="comment"># probabilities[0] = probability of class 0 (SAFE)</span>
<span class="comment"># probabilities[1] = probability of class 1 (RISKY)</span>

safety_percentage = probabilities[<span class="string">0</span>] * <span class="string">100</span></code>
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Explanation:</strong>
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <code>predict_proba()</code> returns probabilities for each possible outcome. For our 
                            binary classification (SAFE vs RISKY), it returns two probabilities that add up to 100%.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            For example, if the model predicts:
                            <ul>
                                <li>80% chance of SAFE (class 0)</li>
                                <li>20% chance of RISKY (class 1)</li>
                            </ul>
                            Then the safety percentage is 80%.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Higher percentage = More confident = Lower risk</strong>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        This percentage helps users understand not just the prediction (SAFE or RISKY), but also 
                        how confident the model is. A 95% safety score means the model is very confident the 
                        applicant is safe, while a 55% safety score means it's less certain.

                            <strong><code>predict()</code>:</strong> Returns the final prediction (SAFE or RISKY). 
                            It gives you the answer: "This applicant is SAFE" or "This applicant is RISKY."
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong><code>predict_proba()</code>:</strong> Returns the probabilities for each 
                            possible outcome. It tells you: "80% chance of SAFE, 20% chance of RISKY."
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Example:</strong>
                    </p>
                    <div class="code-block">
<code>prediction = model.predict(features)
<span class="comment"># Returns: [0] (meaning SAFE)</span>

probabilities = model.predict_proba(features)
<span class="comment"># Returns: [[0.85, 0.15]] (85% SAFE, 15% RISKY)</span></code>
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        We use both in our application: <code>predict()</code> for the final answer and 
                        <code>predict_proba()</code> for the confidence percentage.
                    </p>

                <div class="faq-question">
                    Q: Why did you compress the model? Does compression affect accuracy?
                </div>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>
                        <strong>Answer:</strong> We compressed the model to meet file size limits on GitHub and Render. 
                        The compression reduces file size from ~50MB to ~25MB, but it does <strong>NOT</strong> affect 
                        the model's accuracy at all!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>How compression works:</strong> Joblib compression uses algorithms (similar to ZIP 
                        compression) to store the model more efficiently. It removes redundant information and uses 
                        efficient storage formats, but all the model's "knowledge" (the decision trees and their 
                        parameters) remains exactly the same.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Think of it like this:</strong> Compressing a document file makes it smaller, but 
                        when you open it, the content is identical. Same with our model - smaller file, same predictions!

                    <p>
                        <strong>Answer:</strong> Good question! In a production system, we should add validation. 
                        Currently, the HTML form uses <code>required</code> attributes to ensure fields are filled, 
                        but we could add more validation:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Frontend Validation:</strong> Use HTML5 validation (e.g., <code>min="0"</code> 
                            for age and income) or JavaScript to check values before submission.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Backend Validation:</strong> In Flask, we can check if values are reasonable 
                            (e.g., age between 18-100, income > 0) before making predictions.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Invalid data could lead to incorrect predictions, so validation is important for a real-world 
                        application!

                    <p>
                        <strong>Answer:</strong> Random Forest is like asking multiple experts for their opinion and 
                        taking a vote:
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Multiple Trees:</strong> Instead of one decision tree, Random Forest creates 
                            many decision trees (like 100 or more).
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Randomness:</strong> Each tree is trained on a random subset of the data and 
                            uses random features, so each tree learns slightly different patterns.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Voting:</strong> When making a prediction, all trees vote. The majority vote 
                            becomes the final prediction.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Result:</strong> This ensemble approach is more accurate and robust than a 
                            single tree.

                        <strong>Why it works:</strong> If one tree makes a mistake, the other trees can correct it. 
                        It's like asking 100 doctors for a diagnosis - the majority opinion is usually more reliable 
                        than asking just one doctor.

                    Q: What is feature engineering, and why did you calculate interest_burden?
                </div>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>
                        <strong>Answer:</strong> Feature engineering is creating new features from existing ones to 
                        help the model make better predictions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Why interest_burden?</strong> A person's ability to pay back a loan depends not just 
                        on their income, but on how much of that income goes toward loan payments. Someone earning 
                        $50,000 with a $500/month payment is in better shape than someone earning $50,000 with a 
                        $2,000/month payment.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        By calculating <code>interest_burden = (loan_amnt * interest_rate) / income</code>, we create 
                        a single feature that captures this relationship. The model can then easily learn: "Lower 
                        interest burden = Lower risk."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>This is feature engineering:</strong> We're not just using raw data (income, loan 
                        amount, interest rate separately), but creating a meaningful derived feature that the model 
                        can use more effectively.

                    Q: What is a Scikit-learn Pipeline, and why use it?
                </div>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>
                        <strong>Answer:</strong> A Pipeline chains together multiple data processing steps and the 
                        model training into one object.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Benefits:</strong>
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Organization:</strong> All preprocessing steps are in one place, making code cleaner
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Consistency:</strong> The same preprocessing is applied during training AND prediction
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Easier Deployment:</strong> You save the entire pipeline (including preprocessing), 
                            so you don't have to remember to apply the same steps when making predictions
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Prevents Bugs:</strong> Can't forget a preprocessing step if it's in the pipeline!
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Example:</strong> Our pipeline does: Impute missing values → Scale features → Encode 
                        categories → Train Random Forest. All in one object!

                    Q: How does Flask handle the request-response cycle?

                    <p>
                        <strong>Answer:</strong> Here's the flow:
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            <strong>User Action:</strong> User fills out form and clicks "Submit"
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>HTTP Request:</strong> Browser sends POST request to <code>/predict</code> with form data
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Flask Receives:</strong> Flask's <code>@app.route('/predict')</code> decorator 
                            catches the request
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Process:</strong> Flask extracts data using <code>request.form</code>, processes it, 
                            runs through model
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>HTTP Response:</strong> Flask sends back HTML page with prediction result
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Display:</strong> Browser receives response and displays the result to the user
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>
                        This all happens in milliseconds! Flask handles the web server details so we can focus on 
                        the ML logic.

                These FAQs and interview questions cover the key concepts of our Smart Credit Risk System. Remember:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Random Forest is chosen for accuracy and robustness on structured data</li>
                <li>Safety percentage comes from <code>predict_proba()</code> and shows model confidence</li>
                <li>Feature engineering (like interest_burden) helps the model understand relationships</li>
                <li>Pipelines ensure consistent preprocessing during training and prediction</li>
                <li>Flask handles the web server, making our ML model accessible via a web interface</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Understanding these concepts will help you explain the project clearly in interviews and to 
                non-technical audiences!
